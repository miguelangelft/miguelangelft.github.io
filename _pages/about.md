He recently obtained his Ph.D. degree in Multimedia and Communications from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain, in February 2019. During the Ph.D. period, his research has been related to spatio-temporal visual attention modeling and understanding, applying both Bayesian networks and deep learning. At present, he works in the ERC USMILE project, taking part in the Image and Signal Processing Group at the Universitat de València, Spain.

In addition to his work on visual attention, he has participated in projects related to some of his other interests within the Computer Vision field, which include image and video analysis, and medical image analysis and classification. He had also the opportunity to study at Technische Universität Wien, Vienna, Austria, during the Bachelor degree, in 2013, and to do a Ph.D. stay at the Visual Perception Laboratory of Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA, in 2016.
