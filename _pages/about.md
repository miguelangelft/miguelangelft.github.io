Miguel-Ángel Fernández-Torres received the Audiovisual Systems Engineering degree, the Master degree in Multimedia and Communications and the Ph.D. degree in Multimedia and Communications from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain, in 2013, 2014 and 2019, respectively. During the Ph.D. period, his research was related to spatio-temporal visual attention modelling and understanding, applying both Bayesian networks and deep learning. After two years as a teaching assistant at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain, he works at present as a postdoctoral researcher in the ERC USMILE, H2020 XAIDA and ESA DeepExtremes projects, taking part in the Image and Signal Processing Group at the Universitat de València, Spain. His current research within the area of Machine Learning for Earth and Climate Sciences involves the design and understanding of explainable deep generative models and machine attention mechanisms to be deployed for anomaly and extreme event detection.

In addition to his work on visual attention, he has participated in other projects within the Computer Vision field, which includes image and video analysis, and medical image analysis and classification. He had also the opportunity to study at Technische Universität Wien, Vienna, Austria, during his Bachelor degree, in 2013, and to do two research stays at the Visual Perception Laboratory of Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA, and the International Future Lab AI4EO at Technische Universität München, Munich, Germany, in 2016 and 2022, respectively.
